# Predicting-Sales-Through-Ads-on-Social-Networking-Site

The object of this project is to develop a model that can predict whether a customer is going to buy a SUV car after watching its ad on a social networking site.

We have been given a dataset that contains information about the customer's age, estimated salary, gender and whether the customer bought the new car.

So basically this is a classification problem with a binary output on whether the customer bought the new SUV or not.

So here we will apply various classification algorithms after splitting the dataset into train and test dataset.

After making the model the accuracies of different algorithms came out as the following :

Logistic Regression -  89%

KNN - 93%

SVM(Support Vector Machine) - 90%

Kernel SVM - 93 %

Naive Bayes -  90%

Decision Tree -  91 %

Random Forest - 91 %


so from the above results we can deduce that the accuracies are around 90% with best accuracies being shown by the KNN and Kernel SVM algorithms.
